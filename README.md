👋 About Me

I’m someone who unexpectedly found a passion for technology. As the tech world grew, I wanted to understand it well enough to stay competitive — and eventually discovered I genuinely enjoy working with data.

My journey led me to the Business Intelligence Analytics program at TripleTen, where I’ve been developing skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and data-driven decision-making. I’m finishing the program soon and continuing my growth by taking AI courses this Spring.

Before tech, I earned my MBA from Strayer University and a Business Administration degree (Management concentration) from East Carolina University — go ECU!

🎉 Fun Facts

I love writing,studying foreign languages, reading, video games, and sports (basketball, soccer, flag football, boxing).

I’m an “idea guy” — naming things and brainstorming concepts is one of my superpowers.

I’m a decent impressionist.

I have freakishly long arms and fingers for my size — and honestly, I’m proud of it.

If you’d like to collaborate, the best ways to reach me are through email or my LinkedIn page, which are both listed on my profile. Looking forward to collaborating and assisting with your project !
